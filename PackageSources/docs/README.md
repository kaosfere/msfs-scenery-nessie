# The Mystery of Loch Ness

This is a silly little scenery that populates MSFS with Loch Ness's most famous
resident.  It pairs well with the Fort Augustus scenery by TheGarner available
at https://flightsim.to/file/131/fort-augustus-airfield.

Nessie herself is imported from a 3d object created by the user "Vanitaem V." at
3D Warehouse.  The usage information says one can "use it for any works you need
to", so it is incorporated here according to that grant.

I would love to make Nessie swim across the lake, so that she was always in a
different location.  However, creating new world scripts is undocumented and my
initial attempts have all been grossly unsuccessful.  Once there are docs or the
SDK is updated to allow this to happen, it will be added.
